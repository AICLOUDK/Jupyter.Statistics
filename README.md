Jupyter Notebook and statistics;

Jupyter Notebook;
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents called "notebooks." These notebooks combine live code, equations, visualizations, narrative text, and interactive outputs in a single document. It is widely used by data scientists, researchers, and educators for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Key features:
- Supports multiple programming languages, primarily Python.
- Interactive coding environment where you can run code in cells.
- Easy to visualize data using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- Supports markdown for formatting text, equations, and annotations.
- Facilitates reproducible research and collaborative work.

Statistics;
Statistics is a branch of mathematics concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides tools and methods to understand data patterns, make predictions, and inform decision-making.

Main areas:
- Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing data with measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- Inferential Statistics:Making predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample, using techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
- Probability:The study of randomness and uncertainty, forming the foundation for inferential statistics.
- Data Analysis: Applying statistical methods to interpret data and extract meaningful insights.

Applications:
- Business analytics
- Medical research
- Social sciences
- Quality control
- Machine learning and AI
